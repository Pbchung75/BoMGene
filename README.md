ABSTRACT – Feature selection is a crucial step in analyzing gene expression data, enhancing classification performance, and reducing computational costs for high-dimensional datasets. This paper proposes BoMGene, a hybrid feature selection method that effectively integrates two popular techniques: Boruta and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR). The method aims to optimize the feature space and enhance classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted on 25 publicly available gene expression datasets, employing widely used classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting. The results show that using the Boruta–mRMR combination cuts down the number of features chosen compared to just using mRMR, which helps to speed up training time while keeping or even improving classification accuracy compared to using individual feature selection methods. The proposed approach demonstrates clear advantages in accuracy, stability, and practical applicability for multi-class gene expression data analysis.
